AtomicInteger in Java â€“ Simplifying Thread-Safe Operations

When multiple threads update a shared variable, using a simple int can cause race conditions. Thatâ€™s where AtomicInteger comes in.

ðŸ”¹ What is AtomicInteger?
- A class in java.util.concurrent.atomic package.

- Provides an int value that can be updated atomically (without explicit synchronization).

- Operations like increment, decrement, compare-and-set are thread-safe.

ðŸ”¹ Why to use it?
âœ… Avoids race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
âœ… Faster than using synchronized blocks.
âœ… Useful for counters, sequence generators, and tracking concurrent events.

ðŸ‘‰ Takeaway:
If you need a thread-safe counter or sequence generator in Java, always consider AtomicInteger before going for locks. Itâ€™s efficient, simple, and highly optimized.

"In this architecture, we use the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern. The CMS service exposes a REST API specifically designed for the Publishing Tool, so the client can request all XML files for a given publication and version. When the request is made, the CMS service asynchronously triggers a Spring Batch job â€” reading XML CLOBs from Oracle ADB, chunking them efficiently, and writing them to a temporary storage location.

We return a jobId immediately, allowing the client to poll job status via a separate endpoint â€” applying the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern. Each service owns its own database â€” in this case, the CMS manages its XML data â€” following the Database per Service pattern.

This approach keeps the system decoupled, scalable, and client-specific â€” which is why the BFF pattern fits perfectly here."
